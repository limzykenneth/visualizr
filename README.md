# Visualizing the sound of music

By Kenneth Lim

A music visualizer made with Processing.

External library [ControlP5](http://www.sojamo.de/libraries/controlP5/) is required for the control panel.

A MP3 file name default.mp3 is required for the default music to load although it can be bypassed by loading any chosen music file with the file selection prompt.
